    <main>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this site is techinically for a class assignment, but more importantly it is to give us experience through a "real work" scenario. As we work through this fake company we will be able to potentially help a client reach their target audience. Especially with todays ability to get anything and everything. I know for me personally I look up and research a lot of things before I buy or take part in something. If the website is done right it should bring in potential customers, ultimately helping your clients reach their target market and maybe even their bottom line.</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>For this company my target audience is everyone. The hope is that all will feel like they can participate because Rafting can be for everyone and is fun. I want the website to look professional so that those who are more experienced rafters will see it as an experience for them but also inviting for those who are a little nervous about their first time. I also want it to target all groups of sizes and ages. </p>

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Heading Font: Noto Sans KR</h4>
        <p>I chose this font because it has softer curves and without the serif it seems to be a little more inviting. I want to welcome people not scare them away. I feel like it will help them feel the fun and not so rigid.</p>
        <h4>Paragraph Font: Quicksand</h4>
        <p>I chose this font mainly because it just stood out to me. It is a beautiful yet sublte font. No Serifs and definitely goes along with the other font nicely. </p>
        <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
        <p>The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and
            Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
            Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.</p>
        <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
        <p class="colored">Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and
            experienced rafters. No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company
            can make it happen for you.</p>
