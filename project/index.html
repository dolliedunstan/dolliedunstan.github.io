        <h2>We run Rivers to relax.</h2>
        <p>We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for relaxing Tht is why we subscribe to the dry oar
            philosophy
            of boating. Keeping your oars dry for us means taking time to look around and notice the beauty that
            surrounds
            the rivers we love.</p>

        <h2>We run Whitewater for the Rush.</h2>
        <p>That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things after all. We believe that that
            tenseness
            that comes when you are looking down the tongue of a big string of waves makes you appreciate the calm
            beautiful
            water that always follows even more.</p>
